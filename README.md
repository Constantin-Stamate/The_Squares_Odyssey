## üèõÔ∏è About

**The Squares' Odyssey** is an interactive JavaFX game suite that reimagines the spirit of the Ancient Olympic Games through a trilogy of modern, logic-based challenges. Rooted in Greek mythology and inspired by the competitive essence of Olympia, this application transforms traditional athletic values into mental feats of strength, agility, and precision.

The project was developed using **JavaFX**, **Maven**, and **Object-Oriented Programming**, combining dynamic visual interfaces with a modular and well-structured architecture. The core challenge was to create a seamless, immersive experience through animated transitions, while reflecting the symbolic depth of Greek mythology in each mini-game‚Äôs mechanics and interface.

## ‚ö° Key Features

1. **The Game Selection**  
   Three gods are represented here in divine form, and each god corresponds to a specific game. Your choice leads you into a unique challenge inspired by the greatness and competitive spirit of the ancient Greek Olympics.

</p>

2. **The Battle of Gods**  
   A strategic game where players must use logic and quick reflexes to prevail. The game generates a secret combination of 4 digits, and players must guess it. If they guess both the digit and its position correctly, they unlock a god. If they only guess the digit correctly, they unlock a goddess. Players have 7 attempts to guess the correct combination. Each successful guess brings players closer to mastering the divine power and winning the game.

5. **The Sliding Puzzle**  
   A test of mental agility and perseverance, inspired by the races and physical challenges of the Olympics. Players must rearrange tiles to form a complete image, using logic and strategic moves to solve the puzzle. The challenge increases as the difficulty level rises, testing both patience and skill. If the shuffle algorithm results in an odd number of inversions, the puzzle becomes unsolvable, and the player automatically loses. In this case, a new game session must be started to play again.
